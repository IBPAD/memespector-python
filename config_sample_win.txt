;CONFIGURATION FILE FOR MEMESPECTOR PYTHON
;------------------------------------------

[Project]

ProjectFolder: memespector-outputs
; Name of the folder for bundling the script's outputs

;-----------------------------------------------------

[Input configuration]

Input: /path/to/thelistcontainingtheurls.csv
; Must be an absolute path. Outputs will be put in the parent folder
; Can be either: tabular file (comma- or tab-separated) or a folder containing images.
; In Windows, would look like C:\path\to\thelistcontainingurls.csv

ImagesColumn: imageurl
; ** Required for tabular file. **
; Should indicate the header for a column containing image file names or URL addresses, depending on whether files are local or remote.
; Header must be unique within the file.

InputImageFolder:
; ** Required for local images, when reference in table or list is a relative path **
; Not needed in case of remote images, if local images are referenced by absolute paths, or if input is a folder
; Should indicate the absolute path of a folder

LinkColumn:
; Optional for tabular file.
; Should indicate the header for a column containing URLs meaningful for each image (i.e. the URL for the post or page).
; If indicated, will be passed on to the generated graph file.

Delimiter: ,
; ** Required for tabular file. **
; Set to the character used to delimit the columns of the input file. Set to '\t' (without quotes) for tab.

Limit: 20
; Maximum number of images to process (use 0 for unlimited processing).

;-----------------------------------------------------

[Api setup]

; Set YES to the modules you wish to activate in your requests
; If no modules are activated, tool runs in 'download' mode and just downloads the listed pictures

ApiKey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
; **Be careful not to share the file containing your API Key **

Label:          no
SafeSearch:     no
Text:           no
Web:            no
Face:           no

MaxResults:     0
; Limits maximum number of results per aspect.
; Set to 0 if you do not want to send this parameter in the request to Google (get the response within the default maximum results for each aspect)

;-----------------------------------------------------

[Output configuration]

TimeSeries: no
; Set to YES to add a timestamp to the file names.
; Useful for being able to run the same dataset more than once and check variations for the results over time.

SaveImageCopy: yes
; Set YES if you wish to download copies of the remote images or make copies of local ones.

LabelScoreFilter: 0.5
; Minimum score to include the label in the processed files.
; Set 0 if you do not want to filter the labels (Google only returns labels scoring over 0.5).


;-----------------------------------------------------

[Advanced settings]

; You probably will not need to change things here

ForceBase64: yes
; Leave 'yes' if unsure.
; Set to YES to process remote images using your computer as a 'middle-man'. Slightly slower and with more network traffic, but necessary when Google Vision API is unable to retrieve images by itself. Some platforms do not allow Google to retrieve images directly.
